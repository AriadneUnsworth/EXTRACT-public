# Hyperparameter Optimization with EXTRACT

This tutorial is about optimizing hyperparameters with EXTRACT. For the purpose of this tutorial, download the movie, whose link is given below. This is among those movies that we used for the Fig. 4 of our paper that introduces EXTRACT. Use the script 'tutorial_fig4.m' as a starting point to tune hyperparameters for most satisfactory cell extraction process. Follow the procedure outlined below. This should give you an intuitive understanding of how to maximize hyperparameters.
